# synteny_plot
Here we use the basics of MCSCAN (python version) to develop a circularized macrosyntenic plot such as the one below:

Pick 4-6 species of interest. Make sure they have chromosomal level gff files. 

The example we will be using is analyzing the conserved syntney for cetacean CD300 gene family.

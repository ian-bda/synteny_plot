# synteny_plot
Here we use the basics of MCSCAN (python version) to develop a circularized macrosyntenic plot such as the one below:

![Macrosynteny_plot_nolab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b5040cd-24a2-434b-ae1b-9854ef52672f)


Pick 4-6 species of interest. Make sure they have chromosomal level gff files. 

The example we will be using is analyzing the conserved syntney for cetacean CD300 gene family.
